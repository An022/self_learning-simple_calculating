## Projects Source Codes:
* [01_hailstone](https://github.com/An022/stanCode-SC101/blob/main/SC101_Projects/breakout/breakout.py)
  ```
  User enter a number, and this program will compute Hailstone sequences.
  Hailstone Sequences follow rules:
  If a number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
  If a number is even, divide it by 2
  pre-condition: Waiting user to input a number.
  post-condition: Show user how many the steps are took to reach 1.
