## Projects Source Codes:
* [01_hailstone](https://github.com/An022/self_learning-simple_calculating/blob/main/01_hailstone/hailstone.py)\
  Implement a console program that simulates the execution of the Hailstone sequence by while loop, showing user every calculating steps until the sequence reachs to 1.

  ```
  User enter a number, and this program will compute Hailstone sequences.
  Hailstone Sequences follow rules:
  If a number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
  If a number is even, divide it by 2
  pre-condition: Waiting user to input a number.
  post-condition: Show user how many the steps are took to reach 1.
  ```
* [02_weather_master](https://github.com/An022/self_learning-simple_calculating/blob/main/02_weather_master/weather_master.py)\
  Implement a console program that asks weather data from user to compute the average, highest, lowest, cold days among the inputs.
  ```
  User put in data of temperature, then program will calculate and show information including:
	highest temperature, lowest temperature, average and cold day(s).
	pre-condition: Inform user to put data.
	post-condition: Show the calculating result of highest temperature, lowest temperature, average and cold day(s).
  ```
* [03_quadratic_solver](https://github.com/An022/self_learning-simple_calculating/blob/main/03_quadratic_solver/quadratic_solver.py)\
  This program should implement a console program that asks 3 inputs (a, b, and c) from users to compute the roots of equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
  ```
  If user give the constant a, b and C, we can find roots of quadratic equation: a^2x+bx+c=0.
	pre-condition:Inform user put the constant(a,b and c) data in order to find root(s) of quadratic equation: a^2x+bx+c=0.
	post-condition:Show user the root(s) of the quadratic equation: a^2x+bx+c=0 with the given input constant of a, b and c.
  ```
* [04_print_rocket](https://github.com/An022/self_learning-simple_calculating/blob/main/04_print_rocket/rocket.py)\
  This program should implement a console program that draws ASCII art - a rocket.\
  The size of rocket is determined by a constant defined as SIZE at top of the file.\
  ```
  Pre-condition:
	It's totally nothing here.
	User can input different constant into the SIZE to determine the rocket size.

	Post-condition:
	Print out a pretty rocket which size is determined by the user's input constant.
  ```
